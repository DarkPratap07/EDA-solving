# ðŸ§  Employee Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an employee dataset.  
The main objective is to understand employee demographics, salary distribution, departmental structure, and factors influencing attrition (employees leaving the company).  

Through this project, I practiced:
- Univariate and Bivariate analysis  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Drawing insights about employee behavior, experience, and salary trends

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ðŸ”¸ Univariate Analysis
- Age distribution of employees  
- Average salary and its spread  
- Department-wise employee count  
- Employee attrition percentage (`Left_Company`)  
- City-wise employee distribution  

### ðŸ”¸ Bivariate Analysis
- Compare **Salary across Departments** â†’ Which department pays the highest on average?  
- Relationship between **Age** and **Experience_Years**  
- Salary comparison between employees who **left vs stayed**  
- City-wise average salary  
- Department-wise attrition rate

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Interactive analysis
